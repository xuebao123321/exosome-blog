  "abstract_en": "Exosomes are a subtype of membrane-contained vesicles 40-200 nm in diameter that \nare secreted by cells into their surroundings. By transporting proteins, lipids, \nmRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and DNA, exosomes are able to perform such vital functions \nas maintaining cellular homeostasis, removing cellular debris, and facilitating \nintercellular and interorgan communication. Exosomes travel in all body fluids \nand deliver their molecular messages in autocrine, paracrine as well as \nendocrine manners. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in \nstudying exosomes as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, since in many \ndisease conditions this machinery becomes dysregulated or hijacked by \npathological processes. Additionally, delivery of exosomes and exosomal miRNA \nhas already been shown to improve systemic metabolism and inhibit progression of \ncancer development in mice. However, the subcellular machinery of exosomes, \nincluding their biogenesis, release and uptake, remains largely unknown. This \nreview will bring molecular details of these processes up to date with the goal \nof expanding the knowledge basis for designing impactful exosome experiments in \nthe future.",
