    "abstract_en": "Ocular neovascular diseases (ONDs), including corneal neovascularization (CoNV), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), are among the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies predominantly involve intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, which, despite their efficacy, present significant limitations such as drug resistance, frequent intravitreal injections, and insufficient addressing of underlying pathological mechanisms. This review critically examines recent advancements in the application of exosomes as innovative drug delivery platforms for treating ocular neovascular diseases. Exosomes, naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, exhibit superior biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and intrinsic targeting capabilities, making them ideal carriers for bioactive molecules including proteins, RNAs, and small drugs. We explore the mechanistic roles of exosomes in modulating pathological angiogenesis, inflammation, and tissue repair within the ocular environment. Additionally, this review addresses the current challenges hindering the clinical translation of these exosomes, including large-scale production, regulatory hurdles, and safety concerns. Future perspectives highlight the potential integration of nanoparticles and exosomes with existing therapies, the development of multifunctional and personalized treatment strategies, and the necessity for standardized protocols to facilitate their transition from bench to bedside. By overcoming these challenges, exosomes hold the promise of revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape for ocular neovascular diseases, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract_en": "The treatment and prognosis for TP53-mutant acute leukemia (AL) are notably unfavorable. Tumor-derived exosomes are participating in tumorigenesis and immunomodulation. Our objective was to characterize the exosome-mediated immune landscape in TP53-mutant AL. Four TP53 AL cell lines were selected for study. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to determine the PD-L1 and TP53. AL exosomes (AL-exos) were co-cultured with PBMC. Flow cytometry was used to determine immune cell and PD-1 expression. Transmission electron microscopy and western blot determination of MOLM-13 and Kasumi-1 exosome surface markers HSP70, CD9, CD63, and CD81. Subsequently, miRNA sequencing was performed. In TP53 AL cell lines, PD-L1 protein, and mRNA expression increased sequentially in MOLM-13, Kasumi-1, Molt-4, and KG-1 cells. Notably, MOLM-13 and Kasumi-1 exhibited the highest TP53 expression. Flow cytometry results indicated that Kasumi-1-exosomes had a more pronounced effect on immune cells, resulting in a significant reduction in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations and a notable increase in Tregs. Notably, its PD-1 expression was significantly elevated. miRNA analysis showed that the DEGs were primarily enriched in signaling transduction and endocytosis pathways. Kasumi-1-exos promote DNA damage and PD-L1 enrichment through clathrin-mediated plasma membrane fusion, which ultimately leads to AL immune escape characterized primarily by decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expression and increased Treg expression.",

    "abstract_en": "Cancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent an important component of the stromal cell population within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are intricately linked to tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance. In the TME, non‑coding RNAs present in exosomes act as essential mediators of intercellular communication. Exosomal RNAs derived from cancer cells activate CAFs, which in turn regulate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and drug resistance. Conversely, exosomal RNAs derived from CAFs contribute to therapeutic resistance in cancer by modulating survival signaling pathways, epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, programmed cell death, drug transporter expression levels and immune evasion. The present review examines the role and mechanisms of exosomal RNAs in CAF‑mediated cancer therapeutic resistance and offers recommendations for future research based on the underlying mechanisms of CAF‑induced drug resistance.",

    "abstract_en": "Early diagnosis of breast cancer remains a challenge. Tumor-derived exosomes are considered ideal biomarkers for liquid biopsies in early diagnosis because they carry genetic materials and proteins similar to those of tumor cells. In this paper, a glycosyl-imprinted electrochemiluminescence sensor was constructed as a specificity hunter to capture breast cancer exosomes by adsorbing the polysaccharides of exosomes PD-L1 on a glycosyl-imprinted polymer (GIP); then, PD-L1 and MUC1 were specifically labeled with the aptamer probes of Au@luminol-PD-L1 and Au@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-MUC1, respectively. Breast cancer exosomes were identified by the GIP membrane, and then the potential-resolved ECL signals of the probes labeled on PD-L1 and MUC1 at cathodic (-1.4 V) and anodic (+0.7 V) potentials were recorded, respectively. The platform enables quantitative analysis of exosomes and the detection of exosome marker proteins PD-L1 and MUC1 in breast cancer. The determination ranges for PD-L1 and MUC1 were 2.10 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 2.10 pg/mL and 1.88 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 18.8 pg/mL, respectively, and the detection limits of PD-L1 and MUC1 were 0.105 fg/mL and 1.28 fg/mL, respectively. The determination range for exosomes was 2.36 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 2.36 × 10<sup>7</sup> exosomes/mL, and the detection limits of exosomes were 1.620 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 1.586 × 10<sup>3</sup> exosomes/mL via the signals of aptamer probes labeled on Au@luminol-PD-L1 and Au@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-MUC1, respectively. Based on the simultaneous analysis of the coexistence-specific markers PD-L1 and MUC1 carried by breast cancer-derived exosomes by the GIP sensor, the selectivity for the identification of breast cancer-derived exosomes was improved, thereby greatly expanding the ability of glycosyl imprinting technology to identify breast cancer-derived exosomes and accurately distinguish breast cancer patients from healthy individuals, reducing the risk of false positives and providing a reliable tool for the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer.",

    "abstract_en": "Extracellular vesicles play an indispensable role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, cellular migration and malignant transformation of tumors. Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) have emerged as a key component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), intricately involved in tumor growth, vascular permeability and pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation. Consequently, TDEs encapsulate bioactive molecules in their lumen, facilitating their delivery to distant microenvironments and inducing the reprogramming of specific cell types to establish PMNs. This, in turn, endows cancer cells with robust capabilities for growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. In this review, we consolidate current research elucidating the role of small EVs in cancer progression, with a particular focus on cancer metastasis, and their therapeutic potential. In addition, we review novel exosome-based methods, such as single EV profiling, which aim to open new avenues for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.",
