    "abstract_en": "Bladder cancer remains a significant global health challenge, requiring repeated treatments and surveillance and potentially morbid therapies, particularly in advanced and recurrent stages. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles central to intercellular communication, have emerged as innovative tools in cancer diagnostics, prognosis, and therapy. Their role in modulating the immune response and the tumor microenvironment makes them particularly attractive for cancer immunotherapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of exosome biology, with a focus on their role in immune modulation and potential therapeutic applications. We explore the progress and challenges of exosome-based immunotherapy in cancer, followed by a discussion on the current state of bladder cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, we highlight the roles of exosomes in bladder cancer, emphasizing their diagnostic and prognostic applications. Despite promising preclinical studies and a growing number of clinical trials in other cancers, exosome-based therapies remain underexplored in bladder cancer. We discuss the current clinical trials related to exosomes in bladder cancer and propose their potential future role in immunotherapy. Finally, we address the challenges and opportunities in translating exosome-based therapies from bench to bedside, emphasizing the need for further preclinical and clinical investigations. This review emphasized the potential of exosome-based immunotherapy as a transformative approach for bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

    "full_title": "Overcoming cancer treatment resistance: Unraveling the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts.",
    "abstract_en": "The resistance to cancer treatment is a major clinical obstacle, being strongly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical elements of the TME. CAFs are heterogeneous and are activated through diverse pathways. These CAFs engage in reciprocal interactions with tumor cells, driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. In this review, we discuss the role of CAFs in the development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Besides, we summarize recent clinical trials in CAF-targeted therapies. The development of resistance involves physical barrier formation, metabolic reprogramming, exosome release, DNA repair, bypass pathway activation, multidrug resistance protein upregulation, and immune checkpoint inhibition. Challenges remain in addressing drug resistance despite the therapeutic potential of targeting CAFs: the cellular origins of CAFs need to be clarified, and their limited clinical applications need to be increased. Future studies should focus on elucidating the reasons for CAF heterogeneity, developing precise targeting strategies, and validating the clinical safety and efficacy of CAF-based therapies to overcome treatment resistance and improve patient outcomes.",

    "full_title": "Functions and mechanisms of UC-MSC-derived exosomal miR-486-5p in pulmonary fibrosis.",
    "abstract_en": "Currently, nintedanib and pirfenidone are the two primary pharmacological agents used to treat pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, neither of these medications effectively halts the progression of PF or preserves lung function. As a result, lung transplantation remains the sole viable treatment option for patients in the advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, it is imperative to identify new therapeutic agents that can more effectively address this condition. Exosomes were harvested from the supernatants of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transfected with either control or miR-486-5p-overexpressing lentivirus via ultracentrifugation and subsequently resuspended in minimum essential medium (MEM). The immunophenotypes were analyzed by Western blotting, and their concentration was determined using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis device, NanoSight NS300. The influence of exosomal microRNA-486-5p (miR-486-5p) derived from UC-MSCs on apoptosis in MRC-5 cells was assessed using flow cytometry, and cell proliferation was evaluated through the CCK-8 assay. The expression levels of miR-486-5p, fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes were quantified through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MiR-486-5p inhibits TGF-β 1-induced pulmonary fibroblast differentiation by targeting FGF9. Exogenous exosomes facilitate the transfer of miR-486-5p to MRC-5 cells. The presence of exosomal miR-486-5p reduces the mRNA expression of FGF9, fibronectin (Fn), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), vimentin, COL1A1, and COL3A1, and decreases FGF9 and vimentin protein levels. Compared to control exosomes, UC-MSC-derived exosomal miR-486-5p slightly promotes apoptosis in MRC-5 cells (<i>p</i> = 0.06) but does not significantly affect cell proliferation (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Exosomal miR-486-5p derived from UC-MSCs shows potential therapeutic efficacy in regulating fibroblast differentiation by targeting FGF9, thereby mitigating the progression of PF.",

    "abstract_en": "Bacterial infections and the disturbance of immune microenvironment contribute to chronic non-healing wounds. Macrophage polarization and phenotypic transition play a critical role in modulating the immune microenvironment of wounds. To address these intertwined challenges of bacterial burden and immune dysregulation, an innovative multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform is developed that integrates black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) into exosomes derived from adipose stem cells (BPQDs@EXOs). In vitro experiments show that the platform exhibited broad-spectrum photothermal antibacterial properties, efficient ROS scavenging ability, and the effect of promoting M2 macrophage polarization. In infected wound models, BE + NIR promotes wound healing by eradicating bacterial infection, attenuating ROS levels, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and accelerating re-epithelialization. Mechanistic insights from deep transcriptomic analyses on day 4 and day 10 confirm that the BE nanoplatform downregulates the expression of proinflammatory genes, upregulates the expression of wound-healing genes, and induces cell proliferation. Overall, this novel approach effectively integrates photothermal antibacterial properties, macrophage polarization regulation and anti-inflammatory effects, thereby creating an optimal immune environment and providing a comprehensive solution to the challenges of non-healing wounds caused by bacterial infections.",

    "full_title": "Prenatal alcohol exposure induces microglia to release exosomes with an elevated level of MIP-1α that participates in apoptotic process of stress-regulatory proopiomelanocortin neurons via glutamate excitotoxicity.",
    "abstract_en": "Microglia are known to participate in ethanol-activated neuronal death of stress-regulatory proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus leading to hyper corticosterone response to stress and anxiety-like behaviors in a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. We recently reported that ethanol-activated microglia release small membrane-bound vesicles called exosomes, which carry various neuroinflammatory molecules involved in POMC neuronal death. Here, we determined if macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, a neuroinflammatory chemokine participates in ethanol-induced POMC neuronal death during the developmental period. We used an in vitro model, consisting of primary culture of hypothalamic microglia prepared from postnatal day 2 (PND2) rat and treated with or without 50 mM ethanol for 24 h, and an in vivo animal model in which hypothalamic microglia were obtained from PND6 rats fed daily with 2.5 mg/kg ethanol or control milk formula between PND2-6. We found that ethanol elevated MIP-1α level in microglial exosomes both in vitro and in vivo models. Ethanol-activated microglial exosomes when introduced into primary cultures of β-endorphin-producing POMC neurons, increased cellular levels of MIP-1α and chemokine receptor CCR5 related signaling molecules including glutamate transporter-1 and NMDA receptor subunit genes, calcium influx, inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic genes causing apoptotic death of POMC neurons. These effect of microglial exosomes on POMC neurons were suppressed by a CCR5 antagonist Maraviroc. Maraviroc administrated in postnatal PAE rats, reduces the ethanol-induced death of POMC neurons in developing hypothalamus and suppressed stress-related corticosterone hyperresponse and anxiety-like behaviors during adulthood. These findings indicate that alcohol exposure during the developmental period increases MIP-1α levels in microglial exosomes, which activate CCR5 signaling and cause apoptosis in POMC neurons, leading to hormonal and behavioral stress response abnormalities in animals.",
