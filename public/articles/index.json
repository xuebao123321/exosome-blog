    "abstract_en": "Trastuzumab is currently a key targeted drug for HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC), but there are common problems of drug resistance and cardiotoxicity in clinical treatment, resulting in poor therapeutic effects. Exosomes are natural nanocarriers for drug delivery and engineered exosomes have been widely used in translational medicine research. This study is designed to compare the anti-tumor effects and adverse effects between engineered exosomes carrying HER2 siRNA and trastuzumab. The stable cell line of iRGD-293T was constructed by using lentiviruses, and iRGD-293T and 293T cells were transfected with si-HER2 and exosomes were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. Functional experiments were performed to examine the inhibitory effects of iRGD-exo-si-HER2 and trastuzumab on both HER2-positive GC cells and mouse xenograft models. Blood biochemical indexes were used to test the adverse effects, especially cardiotoxicity. The engineered exosomes modified by iRGD peptide showed higher tumor affinity compared to control exosomes in vitro and in vivo. si-HER2 delivered by iRGD-exosomes significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HER2-positive GC cells, and iRGD-exo-si-HER2 significantly reduced the expression of HER2 in GC cells in vitro and in vivo, showing similar efficacy as trastuzumab but with lower cardiac side effects. Our data indicated that iRGD-exo-si-HER2 shows good anti-tumor effect both in vivo and in vitro, and has fewer side effects compared with trastuzumab. And this study suggested that engineering exosomes with si-HER2 can serve as novel strategy for the treatment of HER2-positive GC.",

    "full_title": "Phosphodiesterase 1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and reinforces the progression of non-small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract_en": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in NSCLC. The RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability assay, and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. PDE1A has been shown to promote metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpressed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of the YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating the STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting RNAs and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated the STAT3 pathway. Mechanistic data uncover a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 axis driving NSCLC metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease.",

    "abstract_en": "For cancer cells to escape from the primary tumour and metastasize, they must degrade and navigate through the extracellular matrix (ECM). The transmembrane protease MT1-matrix metalloprotease (MMP) plays a key role in localized matrix degradation, and its overexpression promotes cancer invasion. In this study, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP is trafficked to the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes, and subsequently released from cells on exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicle that can be retained to the surface of the originating cell by the anti-viral restriction factor, tetherin. Although tetherin overexpression is linked to increased cell migration and invasion in various cancers, its role in these processes remains unclear. Our findings reveal that expression of tetherin by breast cancer cells promotes the retention of MT1-MMP-positive exosomes at their cell surface, while tetherin loss enhances exosome escape and impairs ECM degradation. Thus, tethered exosomes promote the retention of MT1-MMP at the surface of cells, aiding the degradation of the ECM and promoting cancer cell invasion.",

    "full_title": "Stem Cell Exosomes for Osteoarthritis in Veterinary Medicine.",
    "abstract_en": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a growing health concern worldwide. This disease is a major concern in human and veterinary patients, especially in growing and geriatric individuals. The poor regenerative capacity of damaged cartilage affects the healing process. Currently, no effective treatment strategy exists that provides a complete cure. Despite several traditional and pharmacological treatments, none of them resulted in the repair and regeneration of cartilage tissue. Regenerative therapy has gained increasing attention in the treatment of OA as it is directly involved in the regenerative process of damaged cartilage. The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have therapeutic potential in treating OA resulting from their paracrine action on host cells, mediated via cytokines, exosomes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix molecules. Even though no significant side effects are documented, cell-based therapeutics could still present some risks. Exosomes, on the other hand, act primarily by channelizing the resident cells to restore the damaged cartilage and thus play an essential role in the treatment of OA. This review explores the regenerative efficacy of exosomes in managing OA in veterinary patients, elucidating their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Recognizing the importance of comprehending exosomes and their mechanisms is crucial for developing safe and effective cell-free therapeutics for OA. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of cell-free regenerative strategies, paving the way for the development of innovative treatments for OA in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract_en": "Chronic wounds present a significant clinical challenge for which advanced dressings with regenerative properties are essential for effective healing. This study developed an exosome (Exo)-loaded microneedle (MN) patch. The patch was fabricated based on a metal-organic framework (MOF) through a self-assembly electrostatic adsorption process, with the objective of enhancing wound healing. The large surface area, high porosity, and positive charge of the MOF enable the efficient loading of negatively charged exosomes via electrostatic interactions. As the MNs degrade, the MOFs release both zinc ions, with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic properties, and exosomes, which are internalized by cells and enhance cellular regeneration. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the effectiveness of the MN-MOF-Exo patch in diabetic wound healing, while RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the patch accelerated wound healing by upregulating key genes, activating the ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and facilitating angiogenesis, cell migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. This innovative approach combines the efficient electrostatic self-adsorption of exosomes onto the MOF within a MN structure, enabling the precise, minimally invasive, and effective delivery of therapeutic agents directly to the wound site. Furthermore, the regenerative mechanisms of the MN-MOF-Exo patch were investigated, revealing how tissue repair is promoted and how healing is accelerated through enhanced cellular regeneration and localized therapeutic effects.",
