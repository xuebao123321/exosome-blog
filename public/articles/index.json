    "abstract_en": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease globally. Abnormal crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs leads to liver fibrosis and aggravates MASLD. We explored the role of the RNA-binding protein Pumilio in this process. Two isoforms of Pumilio proteins (PUM1, PUM2) expression were analyzed in the livers of MASLD patients and mice. MASLD mice were induced by a western diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (WD+CCl4), or a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD). Adeno-associated virus type 8 carrying Pum1-targeting short hairpin RNA or small interfering RNA targeting PUM1 was used to knock down PUM1 in vivo or in vitro. Ultracentrifugation was used to isolate exosomes from cells and serum. RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments were used to find and identify the target genes of PUM1. The expression of PUM1, not PUM2, was decreased in both MASLD patients and models. PUM1 knockdown aggravated liver injury. PUM1 also decreased in steatotic hepatocytes. Upregulating PUM1 improved lipid deposition and reduced hepatocyte lipotoxic death. Hepatocytes regulate the activation of HSCs by PUM1-enriched exosomes. Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) was identified as a target of PUM1. PUM1 affected the expression of TPM4 by binding to its mRNA, thereby regulating HSCs activation. While PUM1 is downregulated during MASLD progression, upregulation of PUM1 improves lipid deposition, reduces hepatocyte lipotoxic death and inhibits TPM4 expression to reduce HSC activation.",

    "abstract_en": "Recent studies have revealed importance of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB)-derived exosomes (HUCB-Exo) in central nervous system diseases, but the role of HUCB-Exo in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains unclear. This study aims to explore the mechanisms of HUCB-Exo in HIE. HIE models were constructed in 7-day-old neonatal rats using classical Rice-Vannucci modeling, and SH-SY5Y cells were induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury, followed by intervention with HUCB and HUBC-Exo, either non-transfected or transfected with si-NC/si-MFG-E8. HUBC-Exo decreased cerebral infarct size and cerebral water content in HIE neonatal rats and improved short-term and long-term neurological function. HUBC-Exo down-regulated Beclin1, ATG7, and LC3 II/I expression, while promoting p62 expression in HIE neonatal rats. After HUBC-Exo treatment, NCOA4 and ACSL4 expression in HIE neonatal rats decreased, while FTH1, SLC7A11, and GPX4 expression were increased. In addition, HUBC-Exo decreased Fe<sup>2+</sup>, MDA, and ROS levels in HIE neonatal rats. Similarly, these <i>in vivo</i> results were observed <i>in vitro</i>. HUBC-Exo inhibited autophagy and ferroptosis in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells, and MFG-E8 silencing interrupted HUBC-Exo action. Further results showed that HUBC-Exo-derived MFG-E8 promoted p-GSK3β/GSK3β and Active-β-catenin/β-catenin levels in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly, the GSK3β agonist LiCl revoked the promotion of HUBC-Exo<sup>si-MFG-E8</sup> on autophagy and ferroptosis in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells. HUBC-Exo MFG-E8 inhibited autophagy and ferroptosis, thereby alleviating brain damage in HIE neonatal rats. Our results suggested that HUBC-Exo-transmitted MFG-E8 inhibited autophagy and ferroptosis through GSK3β/β-catenin signaling, thereby alleviating brain injury in HIE neonatal rats, which provided a new idea for treating HIE.",

    "abstract_en": "Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent dementia in late life, with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and neuroinflammation are recognized among its primary pathological features. Currently, there is currently still a lack of effective therapeutic drugs for AD. <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> (<i>G. lucidum</i>) is abundant in active ingredients that harbor anti-inflammatory properties in both central nervous system and the periphery. We attempted to determine whether <i>G. lucidum</i> contained exosome-like nanovesicles (GLENVs) and whether these GLENVs can alleviate cognitive impairment. We extracted GLENVs by the differential ultracentrifugation method and identified the components by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The 5×FAD mice underwent a 3-month intranasal administration of GLENVs and their behavioral and pathological changes were evaluated. GLENVs were successfully extracted and identified to contain multiple ganoderic acids; intranasal administration allowed GLENVs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to exert their effects directly. The 3-month GLENVs treatment effectively ameliorated the impairment in the memory and learning of the 5×FAD mice. The GLENVs treatment also reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus of 5×FAD mice, overactivated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and pro-inflammatory factors, and inhibited the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Moreover, GLENVs exerted no adverse effects on liver and kidney function. GLENVs may be a promising candidate for AD treatment.",

    "abstract_en": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), serving as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME), exert substantial regulatory influence on lung cancer progression and treatment resistance through their cargo of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). This comprehensive review systematically delineates the biogenesis mechanisms of EVs-ncRNA and their dualistic biological functions in lung carcinogenesis. Pro-tumoral ncRNA are selectively packaged into EVs through specialized sorting mechanisms, subsequently activating oncogenic pathways to potentiate tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Conversely, tumor-suppressive ncRNA are depleted intracellularly via EV-mediated export, thereby attenuating their regulatory control over tumor-suppressive pathways. Notably, EVs-ncRNA derived from tumor stromal components-CAFs, TAMs and BMSCs-orchestrate immunosuppressive reprogramming through cross-regulatory networks, facilitating M2 macrophage polarization, T-cell exhaustion, and consequent therapeutic resistance. Clinically, EVs-ncRNA hold substantial promise as multifaceted biomarkers, enabling early detection, prognostic stratification, and dynamic monitoring of therapy resistance in malignancies. Moreover, their emerging roles as therapeutic carriers or molecular targets highlight transformative potential in precision oncology. Nevertheless, critical challenges persist, including heterogeneity resolution among EVs-ncRNA subpopulations, standardization of cross-species engineered EV production, and establishment of multi-omics dynamic monitoring systems. This synthesis provides a molecular foundation and translational framework for developing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in lung cancer management.",

    "abstract_en": "Neuropathic pain (NP) is a chronic condition caused by nerve injury or disease. It remains a therapeutic challenge because conventional drugs have limited efficacy and cause adverse effects. Exosomes, with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, low immunogenicity, and tissue-homing capacity, have emerged as promising nanovehicles for precise microRNA (miRNA) delivery to modulate key NP pathologies such as neuroinflammation, neuronal hyperexcitability, mechanical allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia. In this review, we highlight recent advances in exosome-mediated miRNA therapy for NP. We also elucidate the molecular mechanisms and unique advantages of exosomes as both delivery platforms and intrinsic therapeutic agents. We synthesize evidence from preclinical models and initial clinical-stage studies, addressing translational challenges in scalable production and targeted delivery. Through sustained innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration, exosome-based miRNA delivery systems demonstrate transformative potential to overcome current therapeutic limitations, enabling novel NP management strategies.",
