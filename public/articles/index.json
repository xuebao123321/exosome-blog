    "abstract_en": "Thermal burns are one of the most common burns. Studies are ongoing to develop synthetic or biological wound dressings to ensure painless and scarless healing of burn wounds. This study aimed to combine the human amniotic membrane with breast milk-based exosomes and investigate their effects on burn wound healing. 24 Wistar Albino rats weighing 200-250 g and of both genders were used. Rats were divided into control, burn, burn+human amniotic membrane (hAM) and burn+hAM+Exosomes (hAM+Exo) groups. Burn injury was induced by exposing the back of rats to 90 °C water for 10 s. Rats were treated with hAM and hAM+ Exo for seven days after injury. At the end of the 7th day, the skin samples were taken and analyzed biochemically and histologically. TNF-α, IL-1β, type III collagen, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), total protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and tissue factor (TF) activity were determined in skin samples. In the burn group, skin TNF- α levels increased, IL-1β and type III collagen levels decreased. Wound healing therapy reversed these results. In the hAM+Exo group, the TNF-α level was lower, and IL-1β and type III collagen levels were higher than in the hAM group. MDA and total protein levels increased, and GSH, tissue factor, and SOD activities decreased in the burn group. In hAM and hAM+Exo groups, MDA levels decreased, and GSH and SOD activity increased compared to the burn group. The GSH levels were significantly higher in the hAM+Exo group compared to the hAM group. In conclusion, combining exosomes and amniotic membrane induced changes consistent with better wound healing than amniotic membrane alone.",

    "abstract_en": "Pulmonary metastatic melanoma (PMM) is an aggressive malignancy with limited response and rapid resistance to clinical chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and biological therapies. Here, we developed a targeted biomimetic drug delivery system, TP-siRC@tHyNPs, by fusing exosomes derived from engineered cells overexpressing DR5 single-chain variable fragments (DR5-Exo) with liposomes coencapsulating triptolide (TP) and CYP3A4-siRNA (TP-siRC@Lip). DR5-Exo facilitated the targeted delivery of drug to tumor cells through DR5 receptor recognition and simultaneously activated apoptotic pathways. Moreover, CYP3A4-siRNA effectively prolonged the half-life of TP, thereby enhancing its antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that TP-siRC@tHyNPs induced immunogenic cell death, reprogrammed macrophage polarization, arrested cell cycle progression, and triggered apoptotic pathways. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TP-siRC@tHyNPs specifically accumulated in lung tissue, notably inhibiting the growth of PMM while exhibiting negligible toxicity in tumor-bearing mice. Overall, this study provides a promising strategy for targeting PMM treatment, improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity.",

    "abstract_en": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a major subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), is a significant global health burden owing to its late-stage diagnosis and poor prognosis. Recent advancements in molecular biology, genomics, and imaging have transformed the landscape of OSCC diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of early molecular diagnostic strategies, including biomarker discovery using next-generation sequencing, liquid biopsy, and salivary exosomal microRNAs. In addition, we highlight the emerging role of non-invasive optical imaging technologies and their clinical integration for improved surgical precision and early lesion detection. This review also discusses evolving therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and patient-centered multimodal regimens tailored through molecular profiling. We emphasized balancing therapeutic efficacy with the quality of life in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The convergence of multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine holds promise for revolutionizing early detection and personalized treatment of OSCC, ultimately improving patient survival and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract_en": "The study of exosomes is currently an area of major interest in the scientific world, especially after the discovery of their function as natural nanocarriers. Their intrinsic features in regulating intricate intracellular pathways have put them in the spotlight in the last decade, and it has been considered that by harnessing them, the future of cellular communication and therapeutic innovation will experience a breakthrough, leading to pioneering research. However, it has been demonstrated that exosomes have various important roles, from conferring resistance to viral infections of the human placenta to transfer of oncogenic signals between cells, reshaping cellular metabolism, promoting angiogenesis, mediating immune evasion, serving as biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and having implications in the therapeutic management of certain diseases. Besides the general overview of exosomes as nature's nanocarriers and their functions, this article aims to discuss their implications in PitNETs, especially since there have been many recent studies regarding the clinical benefits of biomolecular medicine.",

    "abstract_en": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing a pivotal factor in poor prognosis and high fatality rates. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the key molecular events and regulatory mechanisms driving HCC metastasis, with a particular focus on genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and dysregulated signaling pathways. Special emphasis is placed on the role of three-dimensional genome structural remodeling in HCC initiation and metastatic progression. Additionally, the latest advances in targeted therapies for advanced HCC are summarized, including both first-line and second-line treatments, highlighting their impact on controlling metastatic disease. The review also examines a variety of potential biomarkers linked to HCC metastasis, including circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and exosomal contents, all of which demonstrate significant promise for the early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of HCC metastasis. By bridging molecular insights with clinical applications, this review provides valuable perspectives to guide future research in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC metastasis.",
