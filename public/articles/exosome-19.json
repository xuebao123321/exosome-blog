  "abstract_en": "The use of extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, as carriers of \nbiomarkers in extracellular spaces has been well demonstrated. Despite their \npromising potential, the use of exosomes in the clinical setting is restricted \ndue to the lack of standardization in exosome isolation and analysis methods. \nThe purpose of this review is to not only introduce the different types of \nextracellular vesicles but also to summarize their differences and similarities, \nand discuss different methods of exosome isolation and analysis currently used. \nA thorough understanding of the isolation and analysis methods currently being \nused could lead to some standardization in the field of exosomal research, \nallowing the use of exosomes in the clinical setting to become a reality.",
