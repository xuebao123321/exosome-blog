  "abstract_en": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that share components of their parent cells \nand are attractive in biotechnology and biomedical research as potential disease \nbiomarkers as well as therapeutic agents. Crucial to realizing this potential is \nthe ability to manufacture high-quality exosomes; however, unlike biologics such \nas proteins, exosomes lack standardized Good Manufacturing Practices for their \nprocessing and characterization. Furthermore, there is a lack of \nwell-characterized reference exosome materials to aid in selection of methods \nfor exosome isolation, purification, and analysis. This review informs exosome \nresearch and technology development by comparing exosome processing and \ncharacterization methods and recommending exosome workflows. This review also \nprovides a detailed introduction to exosomes, including their physical and \nchemical properties, roles in normal biological processes and in disease \nprogression, and summarizes some of the on-going clinical trials.",
