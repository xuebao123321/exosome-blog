  "abstract_en": "Exosomes are 40-100 nm nano-sized vesicles that are released from many cell \ntypes into the extracellular space. Such vesicles are widely distributed in \nvarious body fluids. Recently, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified \nin exosomes, which can be taken up by neighboring or distant cells and \nsubsequently modulate recipient cells. This suggests an active sorting mechanism \nof exosomal miRNAs, since the miRNA profiles of exosomes may differ from those \nof the parent cells. Exosomal miRNAs play an important role in disease \nprogression, and can stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate metastasis in \ncancers. In this review, we will introduce the origin and the trafficking of \nexosomes between cells, display current research on the sorting mechanism of \nexosomal miRNAs, and briefly describe how exosomes and their miRNAs function in \nrecipient cells. Finally, we will discuss the potential applications of these \nmiRNA-containing vesicles in clinical settings.",
