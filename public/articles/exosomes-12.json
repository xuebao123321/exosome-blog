  "abstract_en": "Exosomes are small, single-membrane, secreted organelles of ∼30 to ∼200 nm in \ndiameter that have the same topology as the cell and are enriched in selected \nproteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and glycoconjugates. Exosomes contain an array \nof membrane-associated, high-order oligomeric protein complexes, display \npronounced molecular heterogeneity, and are created by budding at both plasma \nand endosome membranes. Exosome biogenesis is a mechanism of protein quality \ncontrol, and once released, exosomes have activities as diverse as remodeling \nthe extracellular matrix and transmitting signals and molecules to other cells. \nThis pathway of intercellular vesicle traffic plays important roles in many \naspects of human health and disease, including development, immunity, tissue \nhomeostasis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, viruses co-opt \nexosome biogenesis pathways both for assembling infectious particles and for \nestablishing host permissiveness. On the basis of these and other properties, \nexosomes are being developed as therapeutic agents in multiple disease models.",
