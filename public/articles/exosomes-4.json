  "abstract_en": "Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles that are involved in the intercellular \ntransportation of materials. Therapeutics, such as small molecules or nucleic \nacid drugs, can be incorporated into exosomes and then delivered to specific \ntypes of cells or tissues to realize targeted drug delivery. Targeted delivery \nincreases the local concentration of therapeutics and minimizes side effects. \nHere, we present a detailed review of exosomes engineering through genetic and \nchemical methods for targeted drug delivery. Although still in its infancy, \nexosome-mediated drug delivery boasts low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and high \nengineerability, and holds promise for cell-free therapies for a wide range of \ndiseases.",
