  "abstract_en": "The study of exosomes is currently an area of major interest in the scientific world, especially after the discovery of their function as natural nanocarriers. Their intrinsic features in regulating intricate intracellular pathways have put them in the spotlight in the last decade, and it has been considered that by harnessing them, the future of cellular communication and therapeutic innovation will experience a breakthrough, leading to pioneering research. However, it has been demonstrated that exosomes have various important roles, from conferring resistance to viral infections of the human placenta to transfer of oncogenic signals between cells, reshaping cellular metabolism, promoting angiogenesis, mediating immune evasion, serving as biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and having implications in the therapeutic management of certain diseases. Besides the general overview of exosomes as nature's nanocarriers and their functions, this article aims to discuss their implications in PitNETs, especially since there have been many recent studies regarding the clinical benefits of biomolecular medicine.",
