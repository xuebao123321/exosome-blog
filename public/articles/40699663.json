  "abstract_en": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing a pivotal factor in poor prognosis and high fatality rates. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the key molecular events and regulatory mechanisms driving HCC metastasis, with a particular focus on genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and dysregulated signaling pathways. Special emphasis is placed on the role of three-dimensional genome structural remodeling in HCC initiation and metastatic progression. Additionally, the latest advances in targeted therapies for advanced HCC are summarized, including both first-line and second-line treatments, highlighting their impact on controlling metastatic disease. The review also examines a variety of potential biomarkers linked to HCC metastasis, including circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and exosomal contents, all of which demonstrate significant promise for the early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of HCC metastasis. By bridging molecular insights with clinical applications, this review provides valuable perspectives to guide future research in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC metastasis.",
